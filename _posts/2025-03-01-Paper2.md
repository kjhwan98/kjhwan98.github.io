## Empowering Individual Preferences in Mobile Notifications: A Balanced Approach to Cognitive Load and Information Needs <br/>
### IEEE Access<br/> 
### [SCIE 논문](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916668)
#### 초록
Excessive smartphone notifications can disrupt workflows and intensify fatigue. Although existing approaches have made significant progress in reducing interruptions using sensor- or context-based timing, less attention has been paid to personal preferences and mental fatigue. To address these limitations, we propose a user-driven notification-reception mode configuration system with three customizable modes (Immediate, While in Use, and On Demand), enabling users to determine how and when they receive notifications at both the app and keyword levels. In a two-week field study with 26 participants, our system effectively reduced notification volume, lowered habitual phone-checking, and maintained stable usage times. Additionally, the participants reported decreases in smartphone addiction scores and notification fatigue. Finally, we discuss the broader significance of personalized notification management in promoting healthier device engagement and mental well-being, emphasizing how fine-grained customization can mitigate overstimulation, support digital wellness, and provide design implications for future notification systems.
