# About Me
I am interested in data science. In particular, I would like to do research on intelligent systems.
I started coding late, so I'm still lacking in skills, but I'm studying with passion and responsibility.
My goal is to develop a system that maximizes benefits for users and make my technology a service.

# Interests
I am interested in machine learning and deep learning research through Python. Not only that, but also new trending technologies.
I developed adaptability through challenging experiences and grew up using failure as a lesson. Every time I gained experience, I was able to broaden my horizons and improve my skills.
